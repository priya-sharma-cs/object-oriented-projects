# OOP Projects

This repository contains small projects developed to strengthen my understanding
of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through practical implementation.
The projects focus on clean design, real-world problem solving, and core OOP principles.

##  Concepts Covered
- Classes and Objects  
- Encapsulation  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Abstraction  
- Constructor usage  
- Modular and reusable code

##  Notes
These projects were created as part of my learning journey.
I fully understand the codebase and can explain the design,
logic, and OOP concepts used in each project.

##  Future Plans
- Add more advanced projects
- Build larger real-world applications
- Improve design patterns and system architecture skills
